Created this file. I'm constantly changing my plans as to what feature should be implemented, what feature should be implemented first, 
how connect features with each other, etc etc etc. So this file will be like a logbook for me. And timetracker %) 

So, at the moment I'm not sure about full feature list, and still don't have a clear idea of each feature and how it should look like. First of all I need 
smart alarmclock and time tracker / time logger. This is a really important feature that can help me organize my life and be more productive. 

Now I'm going to start with timer-alarmclock, it will give me a little more time, because I will wake up earlier, and it will also save me some money, 
because if I wake up early, I'll have time to have breakfast at home.
