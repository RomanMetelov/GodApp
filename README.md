# GodApp SecretaryApp Diary LifeAssistant Organizer idk

So, what do I want to get:

First of all:
1. Push Time Tracker (Time Tracker with Push Notifications)

1.1 Task editor - each push could be connected to task or not. Each task can be connected to daily plan so in the end of the day you can rate your day,
automatically, and also see the whole picture per day/week/etc

1.2 Calendar - you can set daily "work" hours, customize it for some if it is not fits in your regular schedule. Calendar also sends you notification-reminders.
So we have several types of push-notifications, several sounds, etc.

1.3 smart alarm - unable to stop by pressing volume and lock and menu buttons; requires enter complicated pin code or solve zadachu


# All ideas:

1. Achievments diary (winnings), diary of what's done.
2. all my notes, everything that i want to save: my thoughts, useful links, quotes and clishes from books movies and blogers, everything that i'd like to save
notes separated by folders and channels (like telegram) and with tags. I'd like to have educational, financial records, daily, weekly plans, year and decade plans
I'd like to create notes about cafes, cinema halls with my review and mark, cars, bikes, food, beverages, hotels. 
Why do I need all these records - life is too short to watch one movie several times
And about friends/colleagues DB - after each social contact add useful notes, advises what to talk about in the next meeting. Meeting notes.
3. custom calendar + alarm + push notifications
4. music player - music divided by genres, bands/singer, tags like 'work' 'chill' 'gym' 'lonely hookah' 'hookah in company' 'road to work'
'sunny road' 'night road' 'lectures about 1..N' etc plus randomizer - every recently listened song should jump to the end of the list immediately; 
first 2-3 hundreds songs mixed randomly. Same for music picked by tags/bands/genres
5. work/study organizer (probably it must be united with p.2) - I'm going to have 2 or 3 works plus sport bets plus sport predicts 
plus krypto and stocks investments
6. technical skills and personal qualities map - I need to see clearly what I need to improve, what new quality I try to reach, 
what are my bad habits and how many days I'm avoiding them, how am I spend my day, my week, my year, my life, 
am I reaching my goals or I'm becoming more far from them - this block also related to others -  organizer, notes, etc. 
Also I have to have main life strategy or goals
7. also something like Tihran's remembery - for repeating technical things, traffic rules, life principles, 
useful thoughts which must be implemented in my life, languages of course, etc
8. weather with wind and rain forecast
9. sport calendar - with subscribe on your favorite teams/championships/players with notifications like 'today is 100500 games, let's bet'
10. sport predictions aggregator.
11. tg-bot - u send message to bot and it creates new story in your app, which could be dragged and dropped to other blocks
12. for remembery - user can create it's own questionnaire
13. time tracker - sends pushes each 15 minutes. You don't need to launch app, you are creating
14. app paradise - with news but without hate content
15. Visualizer money incomes and outcomes, time tracking, money tracking
16. to do today
17. bets statistic, bookmakers and sports analytics, digest, podkast, blog, inst
18. dices
19. cosmos
20. memory cleaning per module by user
21. 

XX. maybe it already was: Knowledge Base
for knowledge base - tags, for task - tags, for music - tags, for food, movie, books, useful links, useless links

# technical requirements

A. demo/user modes, user/admin user profiles. Demo user for the first launch and by call. 

B. my data is very important for me, so all connections must be secured, all data transfers must be secured, backup for data, biometric, password,
password restore

C. I'd like to have possibility be connected from several devices.

D. Maybe we can make to versions: MVP-rxJava-layouts and MVVM-coroutines-compose

E. Protected master branch of course

F. idk

G. we can use as backend github api, tg api, firebase

H. 

...

Z. video demo for interviewers

?? - "Android sample app following best practices: Kotlin, Compose, Coroutines and Flow, Hilt, JetPack Navigation, ViewModel, MVVM and MVI, Retrofit, Coil" - ??
